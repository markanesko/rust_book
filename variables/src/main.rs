// differences betwwen variables and constants

// First, you arenâ€™t allowed to use mut with constants. Constants arenâ€™t just immutable by defaultâ€”theyâ€™re always immutable.
// With constants you must always annotate the type.
// Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.
// The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a function call or any other value that could only be computed at runtime.


// rust has scalar and compund types
// Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.
// 8-bit	i8	u8
// 16-bit	i16	u16
// 32-bit	i32	u32
// 64-bit	i64	u64
// 128-bit	i128	u128
// arch	    isize	usize

// rusts char type is four bytes in size and such as that it represents the unicode scalar value
